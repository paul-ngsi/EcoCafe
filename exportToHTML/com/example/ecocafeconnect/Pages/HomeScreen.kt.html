                        <span class="s3">&quot;Ensuring the proper segregation of different types of waste is key to ensure that more waste is recycled and does not end up in landfills or nature. Recyclable exchange stations, where plastic waste is exchanged for coupons or cash is one of the solutions to encourage people to better segregate. The port of Cagayan de Oro is piloting this solution with WWF and BEST.</span><span class="s0">\n</span><span class="s3">&quot; </span><span class="s2">+</span>

This is happening right now in the Philippines, thanks to an innovative program run by Basic Environment Systems and Technology Inc.

                        <span class="s3">&quot;In the Philippines, over five million tons of trash go into landfills every year. This is a waste of a lot of potential energy, space and resources that could be reused or upcycled into new things. This is something Vince Mercado, President and Managing Director of Extra Philippines, and his mother company, BEST, is eager to change through their “Trash to Cash” program. Since its launch in 2001, they have been challenging the status quo, viewing waste not as an inconvenience, but as a valuable asset that can benefit us all.</span><span class="s0">\n</span><span class="s3">&quot; </span><span class="s2">+</span>

                        <span class="s3">&quot;By combining customer loyalty and waste disposal management, this groundbreaking program is not just about waste reduction. It is about changing the very way we see and handle waste. By transforming trash into rewards, this initiative is reshaping people's perceptions about waste. Each recyclable material is given a specific number of points, which can be traded for various items, such as goods, services, basic necessities, and even online coupons for bills and shopping. “Cash back is really driven by giving people the capability to earn additional income and to be able to see waste differently,” says Razon.&quot;</span>
